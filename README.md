# UnrealMe

This is the project page of UnrealMe - a framework to create virtual reality applications in Unreal. Before using this Unreal project you need to install the Microsoft Kinect SDK 2.0 on your computer. 

To get started clone the repository and generate a Visual Studio project for your machine by using the UnrealMe.uproject file. The basic demo application map (UnrealMe_Exhib1) will open automatically on the first start, so that you can just hit play.

The project uses Unreal's starter content assets. In order to keep the repository lightweight those assets aren't included, since you can just generate them with your own Unreal Engine instance.
