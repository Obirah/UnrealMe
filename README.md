# UnrealMe

This is the project page of UnrealMe - a framework to create virtual reality applications in Unreal. 

To get started clone the repository and generate a Visual Studio project for your machine by using the UnrealMe.uproject file. The basic demo application map (UnrealMe_Exhib1) will open automatically on the first start, so that you can just hit play.
